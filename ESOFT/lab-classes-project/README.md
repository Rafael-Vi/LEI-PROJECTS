# ESOFT Lab Classes Project

This project contains the code to support ESOFT's first lab classes, dedicated to studying the transition from Procedural Programming to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

It is maintained by the teachers of the Software Engineering (ESOFT) course unit of the [Bachelor in Informatics Engineering (LEI)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt/Course/Course/26) from [Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP)](https://www.isep.ipp.pt).

The project is split in packages:

* **package pt.ipp.isep.dei.esoft.labproject** - the project
    * **.problem.one** - inside the project package, you can find problem.one, two and three
      * **.version.one** - inside each problem, there is a version package for different versions

Students should implement the code for each **_//TODO_**, according to the instructions in the lab class slides.

Classes or packages without **_Solution_** in the name, are the ones that students should implement.

## Who do I talk to about this project?

You should talk to Alexandre Gouveia ([aas@isep.ipp.pt](mailto:aas@isep.ipp.pt)).
